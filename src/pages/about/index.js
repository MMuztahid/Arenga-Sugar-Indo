                US Department of Agriculture reported, arenga sugar contains 337kcal in 100 grams of 
                serving. In addition, 100 grams of arenga sugar also contains 84.21 grams of carbohydrate, 
                211mg of salt, and 84.21 grams of sugar. Like any other sugar, arenga sugar also contains 
                a lot of calories. Therefore, you still need to have limits for the consumption, so the 
                arenga sugar can still be beneficial for you. In fact, arenga sugar has lower glycaemic 
                index than any other sugar. According to the data presented by American Diabetes 
                Association, the glycaemic index values are:

                Glucose has glycaemic index value of 100. In comparison, food with glycaemic index value 
                of 50 can increase blood sugar levels by half of pure glucose. Granulated sugar has a 
                glycaemic index value of around 68, while based on the Contemporary Nutrition Functional 
                Approach book quoted by Live Strong, arenga sugar has a Glycaemic Index of 35 and 
                contains many important minerals. That is why arenga sugar is better than other types of 
                sweeteners. However, it is important to remember that glycaemic index can vary on 
                everyone and may also differ in the types of sugar from other palm trees.

                Compared to other sweeteners, arenga sugar has a relatively low impact on blood glucose. 
                Therefore, arenga sugar is suitable for consumptions by diabetics, who do not produce 
                enough insulin or insulin resistant. For comparison, granulated sugar usually has a 
                glycaemic index of 68 and honey is at 55. Compared to coconut palm sugar and granulated 
                sugar, arenga sugar is higher in potassium, magnesium, zinc, iron, phosphorus, nitrogen, 
                and sodium. However, just because arenga sugar has a lower impact on the blood sugar 
                levels, does not mean that it can be consumed as much as possible. Consuming excessive 
                amounts will also increase the blood sugar in much higher levels.
